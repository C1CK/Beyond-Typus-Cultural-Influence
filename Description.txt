[b]REQUIRES BEYOND TYPUS IN ORDER TO WORK[/b]

This mod adds many new cultures and events to the game to model the influence a ruling empire would have had over it's subjects, similar to the Latin influence the Romans had over much of Europe (Italian, French, Spanish, Romanian, and to a certain extent English)
Also Featuring a redrawn culture map at game start, with new groups, cultures and even countries.

[h1]Mechanics & Terminology[/h1]
In order to explain the mod more easily some common mechanics must be explained first

Settled | In order to settle a province with a new culture, you must either develop it 5 times (Will be slower than using a colonist) (/YOU/ personally, the province view doesn't tell you this information) or place a colonist in the province improving dev. You also /cannot/ accept the provinces culture. If your culture has a settlement decision that grants a colonist you do /not/ need to pass this to settle cultures. Only the AI needs to pass it, but it will help as the extra colonist will allow you to settle more provinces at once. These are the only conditions, however a lot of factors affect the time needed. The primary ones affecting this are; Terrain; Development (Lower dev is easier to settle); And # of times devved by owner.

Assimilated | Assimilated spread is less standardized, but generally requires that the province is converted to the relevant religion and has no separatism. It is used for cultures heavily tied to religious rites (Coptic, Aramaic, Arabic etc.) and spreads slower than Settled cultures, but requires no special effort on part of the player. The time needed is affected primarily by dev, with anything above 30 or below 20 giving penalties, but high dev penalties can be ignored if the province has a university building.

[h1]Cultures and scope[/h1]
More specifics will be given in an event that fires at the start of the game (Not yet added), this is just an overview to give you an idea of the scope of the spread available, If I went into detail about every little nuance I'd run out of space
