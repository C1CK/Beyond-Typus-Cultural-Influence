CHANGES
 - Added bypass for the AI settled culture events to allow it to fire on accepted cultures since AI does not understand the existence of CI

 - Lowered development requirement down to 1 from 3 for Neunordisch settlement of Fennoscandia
 - Lowered development requirement for generic settlement events (Not Neunordisch, Österreichisch or Preußisch) and raised MTTH to 100 years with sharp decline for the first 3 extra development bringing the MTTH to happen down to ~32 years, this shouldn't affect balance too much but will make settling less painful

Version 0.2.2
BUGS
 - Fixed mixing of Frankish and Frankisch inside events and localisation, leading to weird stuff occurring
 - Fixed incorrect localization inside Schlesisch events
 - Fixed mixing of Langobard and Langobardin inside events and localisation, leading to weird stuff occurring
 - Fixed MTTH modifiers of Langobardin, to check for Langobardin instead of Frankisch rule

Version 0.2.1

 - Fixed incorrect triggers for Birth of Anglisch from a junior partner (Checked for accepting of Scandinavian cultures, not English)

Version 0.2.0 Lebensraum (Christ, I kept changing things so it took forever. sorry)

 - Fixed bug where Sudetan could never fire due to same issue as above
 - Fixed bug where New Norse would never spread as it checked for the wrong flag

 - Fixed bug where Low Saxon would never spread as it checked for the wrong flag (Wow I never changed any of these flags. Oops)
 - Fixed bug where Birth of Anglish checked for Danish province with a seat in parliament
CHANGES
 - Renamed many cultures so that they now use the native names for the culture, eg Hochdeutsch over Standard German. This change should help add some cultural flavour to the game, but may make things confusing if you do not speak the language, but I much prefer it like this and it's a minor change
 - Allowed Settlement cultures to be established by any nation with the settled culture alongside all core germanic nation, This should permit things like German marches or vassals being established (Ostsiedlung not required since it doesn't make sense anymore)
 - Pulled Sudeten back to just include Bohemia & Moravia to accommodate Pannonischdeutsch
 - Changed primary culture of Livonian crusader states to Deutsch-Balten as Prussian was only used as no culture existed for the Baltic Region
 - Minor changes to comments in code
 - Removed BOH as the primary nation of Sudeten culture
 - Adjusted Localisation to not use the deprecated $$ style of dynamic localisation
 - Reduced scope of Posen to just Poland proper (May further reduce to Greater Poland)
 - Increased development requirement for German Settlement to 5 from 1
 - Side effect of raising MTTH of German Settlement as it is harder to achieve reductions as there are fewer now
 - Reworked German settlement to using regions and areas as opposed to culture, since thematically it is more geographical anyways and it simplifies the process as exceptions should be less common now
 - Reworked Assimilation to work with both cultures and regions and areas, should make understanding the events easier, as Ænglisch will now spread to all English provinces, AND all of the Britain region
 - German settlement now requires the area to be connected via land to capital (Baltic region never germanicized historically for this reason)
 - Prussian settlement of Pruthenia continues in much the same way as other settlement events but slightly easier, with only 3 development required and no ostsiedlung policy needed
 - Standardization events now convert all relevant cultures to standard regardless of whether they are owned or not, should help with culture gore in the new world (Eventually I'll add colonial cultures but for now just ignore the new world)
 - Removed requirement for no primary cultured nations of the cultures trying to be assimilated existing, as it got kind of strange with italian since the region is so large and diverse (Why couldn't venetian assimilate whilst naples exists exiled on Malta!?) these never worked as intended anyways since the point was to prevent assimilation of a culture whilst a strong force still exist within the region - but this is covered with the requirement to own large amounts of provinces with the relevant cultures anyways. (Also the Knights of Rhodes and Knights of Cyprus are French, thus some crappy little order in the mediterranean can prevent the French from assimilating?)
 - Removed requirement of being a Kingdom for policy of Ostsiedlung
 - Changed culture in Germanic Silesia to Schlesisch at game start (Wasn't really Saxon)
 - Removed the ability for Prussian cultured nations to standardize, Instead they can culture shift to Saxon via an event when Prussian becomes Deutsch-Balten
ADDITIONS

 - Added Ruthenisch as a regional dialect for modern day Ukraine
 - Added Wolgadeutsch for the Region North of the Caucasus Mountains, West of the Ural Mountains, and East of other Settled cultures (Do not fret I will continue east in later updates, but this is a natural stopping point for now)

 - Added Krimdeutsch as a regional dialect on the Crimean Peninsula
 - Added Bessarabiendeutsch as a regional dialect for Moldavia
 - Added Kaukasusdeutsch as a regional dialect for North of the Caucasus Mountains

 - Added Siebenbürgen as a regional dialect for Transylvania
 - Added Scheslisch for German Settled Silesia (Exists in saxon parts of Silesia as game start now)
 - Added Deutsch-Balten for the Baltic Region (Renamed Rissian & Lussian) (Merges with Prussian later so that is encompasses the whole region)
 - Added events for Prussian to assimilate into Deutsch-Balten instead of Standard German (Creates nicer cultural borders, and both regions very similar historically)
 - Added events for Norse settlement of Scandinavia
 - Added events for Expansion of Schlesisch and Prussian into Silesia and De Jure Pruthenia respectively
 - Added Standard Dutch and settlement events for Walloon to become Standard Dutch
