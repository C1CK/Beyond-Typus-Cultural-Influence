 russka_splinter.title:0 "Splinter of Russka Dialects"
 russka_splinter.desc:0 "For centuries, the Ruthenian dialects of the Rus' have ebbed and flowed with the dominant powers of the era. The golden age of the people of the Ruthenia's history, the Kievan Rus', has long since passed. The Ruthenian dialects have been in sharp decline since the Mongol invasions and the sacking of Kyiv. Ruthenians have long waited in hope, and although, many attempts have since been made to unify the Ruthenian peoples under a strong central ruler, it has been a fruitless endeavour. Although Rus' forces defeated the Golden Horde at the Battle of Kulikovo in 1380, the Tatars have still made their presence felt preventing any large scale Ruthenian prince establishing themselves. With no dominant power in the region, communities have begun to split and divide and the once unified Ruthenian dialects have become decreasingly intelligible."

Ukrains'ka has been widely adopted in the green fertile plains of Ukraine, covering such a vast swathe of Ruthenia, its speakers have found a staunchly independent identity, with the dialect almost completely ubiquitous in the city of Kyiv. There is also Belaruskaya, making itself prominent in the dense forests of White and Black Russia, spoken in regional population centres such as Novgorodok and Minsk. The speakers of this language identify more closely to their eastern brothers in Moscow and Tver. Spoken in villages in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains, Rusin'skyj finds itself both geographically and linguistically isolated from its Ruthenian brethren, although there are few Rusin'skyj speakers it is still in a location to become a major regional language.
