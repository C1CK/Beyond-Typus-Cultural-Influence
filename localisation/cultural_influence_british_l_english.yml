With the border wars seemingly coming to an end, our relations going forward with our English kin will hopefully cool and we can cease the endless conflict."

 devolution_of_parliament_1.desc:0 "Now we have full control over Great Britain and our population feels a cultural affinity to our rule now has come the time to make an important decision.

 british_anglo_welsh_spread.title:0 "The Spread of English in Wales"
 british_anglo_welsh_spread.desc:0 "The harsh valleys and moors of the Welsh landscape have led to much isolation within the provinces, but improving infrastructure and urbanization in the country have led to many of the upper classes adopting English as their everyday language to improve commerce and relations with the rest of the Isle; This new crop of English speakers have influenced the language somewhat with their own unique accent and additions to the fine language."

 british_anglo_irish_spread.title:0 "The Spread of English in Ireland"

 arctic_settlements.title:0 "Arctic supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 arctic_settlements.desc:0 "The frigid lands to the far North do hold some value, mostly strategic, but some hardy enough settlers have made these lands their homes and have begun to intermingle with the local populace. This has resulted in those adopting a more 'Arctic' dialect, taking influences from mostly Icelandic, resulting in speech somewhat different to those from the Home Isles."
 arctic_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 norman_settlements.title:0 "Norman supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 norman_settlements.desc:0 "Anglo-Norman relations go back centuries, but with recent developments it is now the English language having influences over the Norman one, rather than the other way around. Many of the local populace has now taken to using this peculiar new dialect as their common tongue to better understand one another."

 aquitanian_settlements.title:0 "Aquitanian supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 aquitanian_settlements.desc:0 "Much of this region of France was once part of the English crown many centuries ago, long before the 100 years war.

 aquitanian_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 burgundian_settlements.title:0 "Burgundian supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 burgundian_settlements.desc:0 "The Burgundians and their Dukes managed to form a state that stretched from the Western Alps to the Zuiderzee, or Lake Almere. During that time, our ancestors and theirs often allied together against the French. In recent years, English settlers have begun settling in the Duchy's traditional homelands, developing a unique Anglo-Burgundian dialect and culture."

 toulousain_settlements.title:0 "Toulousain supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 toulousain_settlements.desc:0 "The Mediterranean Coast of France has a very distinct climate and terrain from that in Britain.

 lower_rhenish_settlements.title:0 "Lower Rhenish supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 lower_rhenish_settlements.desc:0 "The people of the Lower Rhine traditionally spoke a variety of Germanic dialects, often indistinguishable between towns. Due to the importance of the Rhine as a major trading artery, both the British and local German and Dutch traders have developed new ways to communicate. This has now spread outside of the major trading centres, across the countryside, and is becoming a common patois."
 lower_rhenish_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 anglo_frisian_settlements.title:0 "Frisian supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 anglo_frisian_settlements.desc:0 "The Frisians speak a language that whilst unique and distinct, seems to share many similarities to the common tongue spoken throughout England. Traders along the North Sea Coast have began to bring sailors from areas like Great Yarmouth who seem to be able to communicate with the Frisians, despite living across the North Sea. These new communities have developed a dialect that is part Anglian, part Frisian, and now unique to the region."
 anglo_frisian_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 upper_rhenish_settlements.title:0 "Upper Rhenish supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 upper_rhenish_settlements.desc:0 "The further down the Rhine one travels, the more diverse and distinct the local dialects seem to be. Whilst still Germanic in nature, they seem further from our own Cant than those lower down the Rhine. Despite this, our consulates have begun to a community of Anglo-Rhenish speakers, with a unique dialect of English near the Alps."
 upper_rhenish_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 danish_settlements.title:0 "Danish supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 danish_settlements.desc:0 "Long ago, the Danes ruled over much of the British Isles, under their Kings, Sweyn, Cnut, and Harthacnut. Many areas throughout these isles have names that descend from Danish settlements, and many people seem to have similar ways of speaking. The reverse has now happened, where many in Denmark seem to have adopted English terms, and even some of our cultural traditions."
 danish_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 norwegian_settlements.title:0 "Norwegian supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 norwegian_settlements.desc:0 "Vikings of the North Sea used to raid the coast of Britain and Ireland, before their Christianisation, and many settled in areas of Lancashire and Cumbria, as well as around Dublin and the Scottish Isles. Our own settlements along the Fjords of Norway seem to be more resilient, and a new Anglo-Norwegian dialect has appeared - this time in Scandinavia and not Britannia."
 norwegian_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 swedish_settlements.title:0 "Swedish supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 swedish_settlements.desc:0 "Unlike the Vikings of Norway and Denmark who visited our shores, those of Sweden looked eastwards. Along the coast of Sweden, British traders have established small settlements on the outskirts of Swedish cities - initially not allowed inside them. Around those places, a new Anglo-Swedish language has sprung up, and is becoming increasingly common within the upper classes of Sweden, who look for closer ties to Britain."
 swedish_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 finnish_settlements.title:0 "Finnish supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 finnish_settlements.desc:0 "Until recently, the lands along the north-east Baltic Sea have been viewed with disinterest by the British elite. Occasionally, a crate of fish makes is way to us. Yet recently British traders have developed links to Finland as a burgeoning market. Without languages in common, a rather interesting creole has developed, spoken as a lingua franca between our traders and the local people."
 finnish_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 laplander_settlements.title:0 "Laplander supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 laplander_settlements.desc:0 "Up in the far north of Scandinavia, lies Lapland, though our traders tell us the locals prefer the name Sápmi. Those along the coast seem to speak Norwegian, whilst inland they speak a language known to few Brits. Our merchants, looking for the next big marketable trade good, have adopted terms spoken by the local Reindeer herders, developing a new Anglo-Lappish dialect."
 laplander_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 baltic_settlements.title:0 "Baltic supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 baltic_settlements.desc:0 "Along the south-east Baltic Coast, multiple local languages and dialects are spoken. Traditionally, German has been used to facilitate trade. However, to out outcompete German traders, British merchants have been keen to learn local languages. They have some how amalgamated terms from a number of dialects including Prussian, Latvian, Lithuanian and Estonian, as well as English, into a new Anglo-Baltic cant. This has become popular in many coastal cities, with British traditions and culture also becoming common in these ports."
 baltic_settlements.a:0 "Excellent"
 pomeranian_settlements.title:0 "Pomeranian supplanted local dialect in [Root.GetName]"
 pomeranian_settlements.desc:0 "The locals in Pomerania are no strangers to foreign traders in their ports. Previously, the Hanseatic League were dominant, and their Low Saxon language was intelligible with Pomeranian. As our merchants have begun to displace the Hanseatic League, locals have rapidly acclimated to our presence, with small Anglo-Pommern enclaves popping up across the region. Even local nobles now speak a tongue resembling both languages."
