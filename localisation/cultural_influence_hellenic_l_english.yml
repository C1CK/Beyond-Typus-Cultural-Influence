 rhomaioi_split.desc:0 "Even though the Empire seemingly managed to claw its way back out of the abyss and reclaim its homeland and unify the dialects it appears they were not strong enough, with new invasions taking much of the formerly reclaimed land the people have begun to lose intelligibility with one another and the Rhomaîoi dialect has fractured."

 greek_hellas_foreign.desc:0 "With the fall of the Byzantine Empire and the separation of the old Aigaío language many Greeks have looked for a new alternative to reunify their disparate language under our rule. As a result they have turned to the dialect that has formed around [146.GetName] as their new prestige language and have now supplanted the language in [Root.GetName].\n\nWe could prevent this if the province was not already Hellenic, however it would likely anger the settlers who have already arrived in the province."
