 mauritanian_jihad.title:0 "Mauritanian Jihad"
 mauritanian_jihad.desc:0 "The Borderlands along the Western Sahara are occupied by Scholarly Islamic tribes, The Zawaya in particular are nominally vassals to the Hassaniya paying tribute for their protection, however increasing raids from the nomadic tribes into Fulan territories would see the Hassaniya fail to fulfill their obligations under Islam causing rising tensions amongst the scholarly and agriculturalist societies. Eventually culminating in a prominent religious and military leader forming an alliance of Zenaga tribes under an Islamic state in Jihad against the impious Hassaniya. This war would last 30 years, with the final conclusion being a defeat for the Zenaga alliance and Islamic state in Futa Tooro, and the wider cultural subjugation of the Zenaga and ascendancy of the Hassaniya Arabs and Maqil tribes in the Western Sahara."
